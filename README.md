# hololab_wavecorr
A Python package for measuring the phase and amplitude of incident wavefronts in SLM-based Fourier optical systems to characterize and correct aberrations. It can measure wavefronts, compute and apply affine transforms between experimental and target images, and generate holograms incorporating aberration corrections.
